Automatically Detect Facial Landmarks using Tensorflow

### Facial Landmarks

There are a variety of facial landmark definations depending on the points. In this festing, 5 points are defined: 1) Right eye, 2)Left eye, 3) Nose, 4) Left mount, and 5) Right mount. Note that the number of points can be changed.


### Repository Layout

### How to use

### Datasets

There are several datasets for facial landmarks. For example, the 68 point [iBUG 300-W dataset](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/) and the 194 point model that can be trained on the [HELEN dataset](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~vuongle2/helen/).
